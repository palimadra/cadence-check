Cadence Check
=============

A simple WordPress plugin that displays a background grid to check vertical rhythm. Grid size is automatically set based on the line height of the body element.

Please note: this plugin applies the background image to the body element. If internal elements have their own backgrounds, they will cover the background grid applied by this plugin.

To account for this, the plugin adds a "cadence-check" class to the body element. Use this to disable backgrounds in your theme when the plugin is active.
